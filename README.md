# C-code-obfuscator-using-Lex-and-YACC
The goal of completing this project is to familiarize myself with the operations of Lex and YACC code.
From a compiler Design standpoint, the 2 technologies are fundamental to tokenizing and parsing input code.
This project can accept a well-written (read, clean, well-commented code) and obfuscate it, i.e., give a meaningless name to the user-defined identifiers, without impacting the code's functionality. In other words, the output code will not be easily understandable at a cursory glance, but will still function exactly the same as the input code.
The output code will also lack comments, and will be mildly optimized (machine-independent optiizations like arithmetic simplification and constant folding are handled).
The scope of this project is security and improved performance.
